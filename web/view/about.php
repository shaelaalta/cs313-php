                <p>This is my family and after we added Dot to our happy little family I sturggled with finding large kid toys that weren't a total eyesore in my home, yet still functional and easy to store. This store I started became something I loved as I tried to answe all these problems I came across as a mom buying toys for my little Dot.</p>
